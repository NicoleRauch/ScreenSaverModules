This is the description of the screensaver modules
4colprob.ssm, bounce.ssm, golife.ssm, numlock.ssm and space.ssm.

I release these modules as FreeWare and without any warranty
of any kind and so on. Please read the note below concerning
the module numlock.ssm (Numlock Blinker), and please don't tell me
that I haven't warned you!

Below you find a short description of the modules. Please read at least
the first one (Numlock Blinker) because it's a bit tricky to handle.


numlock.ssm (Numlock Blinker):
	When this module is active, you will not see anything on the screen -
	but watch your keyboard!

	CAUTION: 
	You should not stop this module by pressing Num Lock, Scroll
	Lock or Shift because then the key may change its mode. This is not
	my fault because when the module is started, it saves the state of
	the lamps, and before it exits it restores this state. But when the
	state of a key is changed in between, the module will still restore 
	the lamp's state as it was at start time because the main ssaver 
	program only notifies the module that a key was pressed but not 
	which one.
	If you already ran into trouble due to this problem, you can do the
	following:
	If you have problems with the Caps lock key, just toggle it one or two
	times. It will then work fine.
	If one of the two other keys causes a problem, just run the module
	and stop it with that key once again. The procedure will
	be reverted and everything's fine again.
	(This worked at least in my case. If it doesn't help you, 
	re-IPL and pray :-) )

golife.ssm	(Game Of Life):
	This module displays the game of life. You can either select
	a random population to start with, or a "Gleiterkanone".
	The principle is that the screen is divided into cells. In the
	"Module Configuration" window you can select how many cells will
	be displayed in the horizontal direction. The more cells there
	are, the slower the animation will be. Every cell has 8 neighbors,
	like this:
					NNN
					NCN
					NNN

	where C is the cell and N are the neighbors. When a dead cell has
	three neighbors that are "alive" (displayed white), it will
	also come to life. If a living cell has two or three living neighbors,
	it will stay alive. If there are more or less living neighbors, it 
	will stay dead or die.

	The "Gleiterkanone" (glider cannon) is a special kind of "animal": 
	It always returns to its original shape, and it produces little
	"gliders" that flap across the screen.
	
	When the random screen becomes static, i. e. there is no movement
	except for objects that repeat within two or three cycles,
	living cells will be "injected" randomly after 100 redraws 
	to bring the picture to life again.
	Note: Up to now I'm only checking for objects that repeat in two
	or three cycles. If anybody finds objects that repeat with a 
	different number of cycles, let me know, and I will check 
	this number too.


4colprob.ssm (4 Colour-Problem):
	This module was inspired by the article "Dreiecksgeschichten" 
	by Dr.-Ing. Reinhard Ludwig, which was published in the german 
	computer magazine "c't", April 1994, pp. 220. The article included a 
	Pascal program. I translated it to C and modified it slightly.

	This module represents a well-known mathematical problem: to colour
	a given map with 4 colours so that two neighbouring fields always
	have different colours. 
	For this problem a map is needed, therefore several steps are necessary:

	First, a number of random points is created (the number can be varied
	between 5 and 75 in the "Module Configuration" window). Then the
	screen is triangulated, that means the given points are used to
	create triangles (this is called Delaunay-Triangulation). 

	After that the screen is divided into sections, of which every 
	section encloses one of the random points and every pel on the screen 
	that is closer to the random point than to any of the other random points 
	(this is called a Voronj-diagram). This diagram represents the map to be
	coloured. 

	You will notice that there may be five colours: red, blue, green,
	yellow and light blue. The light blue fields are "wrongly-coloured" 
	fields, and after all fields have been coloured, the light blue 
	fields will be eliminated one after the other by swapping colours with
	one of their neighbouring fields and thus finding a field where only three
	colours are represented in the neighbouring fields. Then this field
	can get the fourth colour, and the light blue colour is no longer
	needed. When all "wrong" fields have changed their colours, the process
	is terminated and you can see a map that is coloured according to the
	4 colour-problem. 
	Sometimes the light blue can't be eliminated at the first attempt. 
	Then the whole map is coloured anew, and the program tries again.

bounce.ssm (Bouncing Line):
	Here you see a bouncing line that changes its colours. You can select
	how many lines will be visible and how many lines will be coloured in
	the same colour. On startup, the screen can be painted black or left
	as it is.

space.ssm (Space Flight):
	You will fly through space, the final frontier! Choose speed and
	star density as you like. When this module is run with
	"Low Priority" unchecked, the animation will be smoother.


Enjoy!
